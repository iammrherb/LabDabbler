# Creating a Network Digital Twin with Containerlab and NetBox

<small>:material-youtube: [Packet Pushers Video Byte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMHf8pVNV_c)</small>

A network digital twin can let engineers test changes before they get pushed into production. In this Video Byte, we discuss how to Nokia's Containerlab, in tandem with NetBox, to build a digital twin. [Containerlab][clab] is an open-source tool that lets you run containerized versions of network operating systems and build network topologies. And by pairing with NetBox, a network source of truth, you can pull actual device configurations into your Containerlab environment to build your digital twin.

The Packet Pushers' Ethan Banks talks with Tim Raphael from Nokia and Mark Coleman from NetBox Labs on how make this happen.
