# How SR Linux Lets You Take Control Of Your Data Center

<small>:material-podcast: [Packet Pushers](https://packetpushers.net/podcasts/tech-bytes/tech-bytes-how-sr-linux-lets-you-take-control-of-your-data-center-sponsored/)</small>

On today’s Tech Bytes, we explore SR Linux, the network operating system developed by today’s sponsor Nokia. Why should you care about the network OS running in your data center? Nokia designed SR Linux to support automation, orchestration, and customization. We’ll dig into SR Linux’s support for YANG and gNMI and how that ties into northbound orchestration platforms, how SR Linux provides streaming telemetry, and Nokia’s development kit that lets you customize this Linux-based network OS.

Our guest is Igor Giangrossi, Sr. Director, Consulting Engineering at Nokia
