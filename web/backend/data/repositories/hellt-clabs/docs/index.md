Opensource catalog of [containerlab](https://containerlab.srlinux.dev) based labs.

The purpose of this catalog is to aggregate various labs built with [containerlab](https://containerlab.srlinux.dev) project as well as to provide a platform for community members to share their labs and explain various use cases.

## Categories

A few high-level categories were created to coarsely sort the lab submissions. At this moment the categories are:

* Routing & Switching
* Telemetry
* Automation
* Security

The reason for having a small number of very broad categories is to have a high-level structure in place. This categories are not meant to be the means for searching the specific lab or technology, but rather to provide a way to browse the labs sorted with these categories.

We encourage visitors to use site search when looking for a specific lab/protocol/technology stack. The search is powerful and will yield better results.

## Contributions

We believe in the community effort and encourage you to consider contributing your lab to this opensource and unaffiliated catalog.

If you built a lab and you want to have a platform that offers a beautiful front end for your use case explanation consider raising a Pull Request with your submission.

You can choose whether you want to host your [clab files](https://containerlab.srlinux.dev/manual/topo-def-file/) in this repo' `labs` directory, or in your own repository - both options are fine.

Additionally, you might want to consider explaining the use cases for which you built a lab by adding a documentation article that goes along with a lab - like this [CMP lab](security/cmpv2.md) here.

Or you can keep the explanation of the use case in your own repo/blog and just add a reference to it, as we did with this [BGP VPLS lab](rs/bgp-vpls.md).
