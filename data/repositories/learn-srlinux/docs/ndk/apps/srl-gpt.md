# SR Linux GPT Agent a.k.a `askai`

## Description

NDK framework is universal and allows you to build apps that don't necessarily have to be related to networking. The SR Linux GPT app is a great example of that. It uses the [NDK][ndk] framework to build an AI assistant that lives right on your router and knows its state, logs, configuration and a great deal about the world.

We've written a blog post about the app with a few cool examples embedded. Check it out here - [SR Linux GPT](../../blog/posts/2023/srlgpt.md).

We have published the application so everyone can try it out and unleash the power of AI on their routers. The app [installation process](../../blog/posts/2023/srlgpt.md#installing-sr-linux-gpt-ndk-application) is provided within the post.
