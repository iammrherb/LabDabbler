# SR Linux CLI. Show Commands

This community-oriented practical guide lists common `show` commands available on Nokia 7220/7250 routers running Nokia SR Linux software. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to all possible commands, nor it is a substitution for the [official docs](https://documentation.nokia.com/srlinux), but rather a curated list of *most-common* commands an operator might need in their day-to-day operations.

This Guide is a living document, we will update the chapters with new troubleshooting steps as we go forward and provide containerlab labs to let you practice the steps in a controlled lab environment.

## Structure

The Guide is structured as a collection of chapters where each chapter is dedicated to a specific topic with associated show commands and output examples. Some CLI commands are augmented with the XPATH paths that can be used with gNMI or [JSON-RPC](../../tutorials/programmability/json-rpc/basics.md) management interfaces.
