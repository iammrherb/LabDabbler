# Show Commands

Show commands are the bread and butter of any network engineer. They are used to view the current configuration and state of the network element and are often a key tool used in troubleshooting.

Naturally, there are many show commands available on the SR Linux platform ranging from the basic commands to display environmental information to more advanced commands to display the state of the network element and its protocols. And since the SR Linux is a relatively new Network OS we wanted to make sure you can easily find the show commands you need by providing a growing list most useful show commands cataloged by topic.

Please welcome the new [SR Linux Show Commands](../../../cli/show-commands/index.md) page that gets you on the fast track to finding the show commands you need.
