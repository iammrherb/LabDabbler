# NANOG88: gNMI and ChatGPT To Troubleshoot EVPN Datacenter Fabrics

<small>:material-youtube: [NANOG88](https://youtu.be/dyY4PUFV2nw)</small>

I am happy that during [NANOG88](https://www.nanog.org/events/nanog-88/) conference, I had the privilege of presenting a tutorial that I am now pleased to inform you is available for viewing by the wider audience on YouTube.

NANOG88 provided a remarkable platform for knowledge exchange and collaboration among esteemed professionals in the field of networking and Internet operations. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to contribute to this extraordinary event by delivering this tutorial.

Are you interested in learning about EVPN-VXLAN technologies for Datacenters and creating a virtual network lab using containerlab? Then check this tutorial where we will guide you through the process.

We will cover everything from installing the necessary requirements for Python scripting using libraries like [pyGNMI](https://github.com/akarneliuk/pygnmi), a powerful tool used for operating and troubleshooting network elements with access via gRPC, and with the help of ChatGPT. We will show how to configure many network elements at once using Go Templates and [gNMIc](https://gnmic.openconfig.net). By the end of the tutorial, you will have tips and tricks to perform various network automation tasks in your network datacenter environment and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

This tutorial is suitable for both experienced network engineers and beginners who want to enhance their knowledge of network design and operation with tools like GNMI, python and ChatGPT. The Information is available at [:material-github: Repo](https://github.com/cloud-native-everything/pygnmi-srl-nanog88)

Don't miss out on this opportunity to improve your network engineering abilities and take your skills to the next level.
