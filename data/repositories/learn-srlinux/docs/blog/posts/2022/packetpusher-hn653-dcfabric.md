# Design, Deploy, And Operate With Nokia Data Center Fabric Solution

<small>:material-podcast: [Packet Pushers](https://packetpushers.net/podcast/heavy-networking-653-design-deploy-and-operate-with-nokia-data-center-fabric-solution-sponsored/)</small>

In this Heavy Networking piece we’re talking data center operations and automation. Data centers aren’t immune from the pressures being felt across the IT organization: things like enabling new applications and services more quickly, getting better visibility to monitor performance and speed up troubleshooting, and tying into new capabilities that come from automation, APIs, containers, and microservices.

Today’s sponsor, Nokia, has been thinking about these pressures, and is here to talk about its fabric-based approach to the data center. That approach includes its SR Linux network OS, its Fabric Services System intent-based platform, its NetOps Development Kit, or NDK, and how all this ties together to address your operational life cycle across Day zero, Day 1, Day Two, and beyond.
