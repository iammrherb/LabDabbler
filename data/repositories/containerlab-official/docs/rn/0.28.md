# Release 0.28

## Topology file auto-detect
With embedded shorthands `containerlab`->`clab`, `deploy`->`dep` and so on, we made using containerlab over the CLI a fast and pleasant experience. But even then, typing `clab dep -t mytopo.clab.yml` is one argument too long.

Please welcome the topology file auto-detect feature which turns `clab dep -t mytopo.clab.yml` to just `clab dep` :partying_face:

!!!note
    A single file matching `*.clab.y*ml` pattern must be present in the current working directory for auto-detect feature to work.

    Should you have multiple topology files, use the `--topo` flag as before.

## Ignite-based linux containers
Weaveworks/ignite runtime integration that was added by @networkop for [Cumulus VX](../manual/kinds/cvx.md) nodes got a new application. With #910 merged, users now can run Linux VMs in a container packaging and leverage VM-like experience while running lightweight and fast.

## Miscellaneous

* added `-c` shorthand for `--reconfigure` as it is very handy to use `clab dep -c` to cleanly redeploy the lab during the iterations of lab build-out.
