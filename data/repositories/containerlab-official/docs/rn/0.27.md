# Release 0.27
:material-calendar: 2022-07-06

## Multiple kind names
When we started containerlab, using short kind names was easy. Everybody knew that `srl` is SR Linux, and, say, `ceos` is cEOS. As we grew, more people started to use containerlab and not everyone knew the short names of NOSes.

Therefore we added an ability to use long names for kinds, for example, `nokia_srlinux` or `arista_ceos`. These new "long" names have been added to kind docs.

## Juniper vQFX and Juniper vMX startup config
We finally added support to provision vMX and vQFX with startup configuration. The same [`startup-config`](../manual/nodes.md#startup-config) node property allows users to point to a file that contains configuration lines that will get applied to a network element when it starts.


## Misc

* SR Linux nodes will be able to use the names of the other nodes of the same #891
