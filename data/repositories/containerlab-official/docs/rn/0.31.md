# Release 0.31

:material-calendar: 2022-08-11

## External containers

As _people of cloud_ [started to use containerlab](../community.md#cilium-bgp-tested-with-containerlab) to test features on the intersection of networking and compute domains, it became evident that containerlab lacked an option to schedule a container in the network namespace of an external container. For example, the need was to start a containerlab lab and stitch it nicely to the k8s kind cluster nodes which run some CNIs that are willing to talk to the network nodes launched in containerlab.

With #969 being merged we are adding this capability and making it easy to bridge emulated network nodes with k8s nodes running with kind.

## SAN support for SR Linux certificates

With [`SANs` node property](../manual/nodes.md#subject-alternative-names-san) users can set subject alternative names for certificates that get generated by containerlab. Currently, this is only implemented for SR Linux #968.

## Miscellaneous

* startup config template files can leverage gomplate functions #955
* Logs are now printed to `stderr`. This is mainly done to make sure that when we print any json, you can parse it with `jq` without logging info getting in the way #958
* containerlab version check can now be skipped if CLAB_VERSION_CHECK env var is set to `disable` #959
* mysocketio information will now be printed in json output #887
* gnmi unix socket is now enabled by default for SR Linux nodes #965


## Patches

### 0.31.1

* added support for saving configuration for numerous vrnetlab-based nodes #973
* updated lab examples to be sourced from the main branch instead of master #978
* enhancements to config templates loader #974
